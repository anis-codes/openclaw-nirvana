# Upwork Trends Skill

## When to use
When analyzing job market demand, refining proposal strategies, or generating content about in-demand skills.

## How to analyze trends
1. Scan RSS feeds for job frequency by keyword
2. Track which job types appear repeatedly (signals recurring demand)
3. Identify budget ranges per niche
4. Note specific pain points mentioned in job descriptions

## Current high-demand patterns (update monthly)
- Salesforce Flow migration: surge since WR retirement Dec 2025
- ServiceMax / Field Service Lightning: niche, low competition, high rates
- SF-HubSpot integration: growing as companies consolidate CRM/marketing
- Nonprofit NPSP cleanup: orgs struggling with technical debt post-migration
- HubSpot bulk operations: partner portals, mass imports, workflow automation

## Proposal optimization by trend
- High-volume niche (SF admin): differentiate on speed + certs, not price
- Low-volume niche (ServiceMax): emphasize rarity of expertise, charge premium
- Integration jobs: lead with both platform credentials
- Urgent/ASAP jobs: respond within 1 hour, mention immediate availability

## Pricing signals from market
- "Budget: $1,000-5,000" = small fix, quote fixed price
- "Budget: $10,000+" = project work, propose hourly with estimate
- "Expert level" tag = they'll pay for quality, don't discount
- No budget listed = qualify before investing time in proposal
