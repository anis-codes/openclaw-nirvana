# Proposal Writing Skill

## When to use
When generating Upwork proposals or any client-facing consulting pitch.

## Winning formula (4-part structure)
1. **Hook**: Lead with the most relevant credential for THIS specific job
2. **Proof**: Reference ONE real project that proves capability (no client names)
3. **Differentiator**: SDVOSB status for government/nonprofit, certifications for enterprise
4. **Question**: End with a specific question showing you actually read the post

## Hook strategies by niche
- Salesforce migration: "I just migrated 53 Workflow Rules to 13 Flows at a national nonprofit before the December deadline"
- ServiceMax: "I resolve ServiceMax work order generation failures and governor limit issues weekly for a field service client"
- HubSpot: "I built a bulk upload system that processes thousands of records with full validation and rollback"
- Nonprofit NPSP: "I'm a Senior SF Architect at a national nonprofit - I work in NPSP every single day"
- SF-HubSpot integration: "I've built SF-HubSpot integrations handling real-time bidirectional sync"
- Tech debt: "I just ran a platform health assessment that identified 19,383 issues across a Salesforce org"
- Gov/SDVOSB: "As a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, we bring both technical depth and compliance awareness"

## Credentials to reference (match to job)
- 10+ Salesforce certifications including System Architect and Platform Developer II
- HubSpot certified (Marketing, CMS, Operations)
- PMP and PSM certified
- Enterprise experience: Twitter, Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike
- U.S. Army veteran
- SDVOSB (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business)

## Rate positioning
- Salesforce Architect work: $125-175/hr
- SF Admin/quick fixes: $75-100/hr
- ServiceMax specialized: $150-200/hr
- HubSpot operations: $85-125/hr
- Nonprofit (mission-aligned discount): $100-125/hr
- Fixed price: multiply hourly estimate by 1.5 as buffer
- Never bid below $45/hr for any work

## Hard rules
- Under 200 words. No padding. No fluff.
- Voice: confident, direct, veteran energy. No corporate buzzwords.
- Never mention other clients by name
- Always end with a question about their specific situation
- Lead with what makes you different, not what makes you similar
- Reference specific numbers (53 rules, 19,383 issues, 14 fixes)
- If the job is clearly below your level, either skip or price accordingly

## Anti-patterns (never do these)
- "Dear Hiring Manager" opening
- Listing all certifications upfront
- "I am an experienced professional who..."
- Generic closer like "I look forward to hearing from you"
- Copying the job description back to the client
- Underbidding to win (race to bottom)
